# My Number Guessing Game
My submission for the Roadmap projects. I made my game using Python, so be sure you have it downloaded if you want to give it a go.

Details and for where I found this project & roadmaps I'm using to teach myself Python can be found [here](https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game)

##How It Works
After you clone the repository and you make sure you have python downloaded.
You can then open your CLI and run "python number-guess.py".

##The Goal
Trying to learn new programming language can be hard. So my goal was to try and get familiar with Python's syntax and try to get a bit more techincal with aspects like checking for Exceptions and looking for ways to optimize my code.
